This is a project that wraps the xeno-canto API.

## About xeno-canto

>The service provides a database of bird song and sound recordings contributed and maintained by enthusiasts worldwide. It provides access to search the connection and play or download recordings and to submit new recordings. Discussion forums encourage interactions among members of the birding community to exchange information about bird song and related topics. API methods support search against the database by specifying the formal Latin name of a bird species. Returned data provide listings of all recordings maintained by the service for that species, either with or without URLs for audio and still image files, or optionally a request can retrieve a single representative recording. Methods also provide summary statistics about listings relevant to the species named in the request.
